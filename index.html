                <p>
                    Developed an IoT-based system for real-time bus tracking and student authentication using RFID.
                    <span class="hidden-content">
                        The system consists of two parts: RFID-based student entry validation and real-time bus location tracking. 
                        Students can track their bus using the bus number, while the management can monitor both bus and student locations 
                        using Bus No. or Student Regd No. Designed with a cost-effective approach, the entire setup costs around ₹2000.
